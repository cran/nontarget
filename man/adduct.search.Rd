Detecting and grouping adduct m/z relations among peaks in a HRMS dataset
}
\description{
Algorithm for detecting m/z differences among peaks that may correspond to m/z differences among different adducts.
}
\usage{
adduct.search(peaklist, adduct_list, rttol = 0, mztol = 2, massfrac = 0.1, ppm = TRUE, 
adducts = c("M+H", "M+K", "M+Na"), ion_mode = "positive", entry = 20)
}

\arguments{
  \item{peaklist}{
	List of HRMS peaks with three entries for (a) m/z, (b) intensity and (c) retention time, such as \code{\link[nontarget]{peaklist}}.
}
  \item{adduct_list}{
	Data.frame \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct_list}} or equivalent.
}
  \item{rttol}{
	Retention time tolerance. Units as given in column 3 of peaklist argument, e.g. [min].
}
  \item{mztol}{
	m/z tolerance setting: value by which the m/z of a peak may vary from its expected value. If parameter \code{ppm=TRUE} (see below) given in ppm, otherwise, if \code{ppm=FALSE}, in absolute m/z [u]. Defines
	the "large" mass tolerance used.
}
  \item{massfrac}{
	"Small" mass tolerance used. Given as a fraction of \code{mztol}, see above.
}
  \item{ppm}{
	Should \code{mztol} be set in ppm (TRUE) or in absolute m/z (FALSE)
}
  \item{adducts}{
	Vector of adducts to be screened for. Corresponds to names in the first column of \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct_list}}, thus referring to equations from the second column of \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct_list}}
	to be used for calculating adduct m/z differences.
}
  \item{ion_mode}{
	\code{"positive"} or \code{"negative"}.
}
  \item{entry}{
	Memory allocation setting. Increase value if a corresponding warning is issued. Otherwise, ignore.

\details{
Given a peak from the peaklist, the \code{adduct.search} algorithm screens within tolerances \code{mztol} and \code{rttol} whether any other peaks may correspond to this one peak via adduct m/z differences.
More precisely, the one peak m/z is reset to all possible candidate molecular mass values (M; uncharged, non-adduct). The latter are then used to calculate for all other candidate adduct peaks,
which, if found, are subsequently grouped.

For example, let argument "adducts" have adducts=c("M+H", "M+K"). Given the m/z-value of the one peak, two other peaks with 
((m/z*z("M+H")-X("M+H"))/z("M+K"))+X("M+K") and ((m/z*z("M+K")-X("M+K"))/z("M+H"))+X("M+H") are searched for. The peak found for
the first term (i.e. with "M+H" being the candidate adduct of the one peak) leads to one group of associated adduct peaks (M+H<->M+K). Another adduct
peak (i.e. with "M+K" being the candidate adduct of the one peak) would lead to a second group of associated adduct peaks (M+K<->M+H). 
Logically, larger adduct groups than the one exemplified can be present, if argument "adducts" allows for it (e.g. M+H<->M+K,M+H<->M+Na,M+Na<->M+K).

\note{
Input peaklist is internally sorted and saved in the lists returned by (a) increasing retention time and (b) m/z by all \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}}, \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct.search}} 
and \code{\link[nontarget]{homol.search}}. Peak IDs refer to this very order - in contrast to group IDs. Different group IDs exist for adduct groups, isotope pattern groups and homologue series peak 
groups. Moreover, and at the highest level, yet other IDs exist for the individual components (see note section of \code{\link[nontarget]{combine}}).

Adduct groups may overlap, indicating a conflict in assigning adducts correctly.
Beware, some different adduct equation combinations in column two of \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct_list}} may lead to the same results
(e.g. M+H<->M+Na vs M+3H<->M+3Na).

Group IDs are valid both for adduct[[1]] and adduct[[3]].
