\title{
Combining isotope, adduct and homologue series relations in HRMS data sets.
}
\description{
Combines groups of isotope pattern peaks from \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}} and groups of adduct peaks \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct.search}}	
to components, with information on homologue series relations from \code{\link[nontarget]{homol.search}} attached. Includes some checks for component 
plausibility. Needs at least two inputs of (1) isotope pattern relations, (2) adduct relations and (3) homologue series relations. Extracts the most intensive peak
per component, thus allowing for consistent comparison of component occurrence across different HRMS data sets. 

Individual components and peak relations therein can then be plotted with \code{\link[nontarget]{plotcomp}}.
Numbers for detected isotope m/z differences among components can be summarized with \code{\link[nontarget]{plotisotopes}}.
Subsets of components and HRMS data can be interactively selected for with \code{\link[nontarget]{ms.filter}}.

\details{
The algorithm sorts relations among peaks in HRMS data sets generated by \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}}, \code{\link[nontarget]{adduct.search}} and
\code{\link[nontarget]{homol.search}} to components in a repetition of four consecutive steps. 
In a first step, and along decreasing peak intensities, individual peaks are checked for being part of an isotope pattern group and thus relatable to other peaks.
In a second step, all peaks within this group from the first step are checked for being part of adduct groups, thus relating to more peaks. 
Step one and two thereby lead to the set of peaks defining a component. 
In a third step, all peaks in a component are checked for having adduct or isotope pattern relations to other peaks not yet subsumed into the component, e.g. as
a result of overlapping isotope pattern groups. These additional peaks are therefore defined as interfering peaks.
In a fourth step, all peaks found for a component are, if available, related to homologue series they may be part of.
Once assigned to a component, peaks take not further part in subsequent repetitions of step one (except for interfering peaks, if \code{rules[1]=TRUE}), or any of the other steps.

Four plausibility checks are implemented, represented by \code{warning} indices 1 to 4.
The first test checks whether the adduct relations found for the peaks assorted under above steps one and two are consistent. If ambiguous adduct relations (e.g. M+H<->M+K AND M+Na<->M+NH4)
are found for at least one peak, warning 1 is tagged to the concerned component.
The second test checks whether variations in peak intensities within isotope pattern groups are consistent among the different adducts of the same component. This
must account for uncertainty in peak intensities via argument inttol of \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}}. 
The third check examines whether interfering peaks occur.
The fourth check takes effect if a component consists of merged isotope pattern groups (only relevant if several z-levels were employed, see charges argument of \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}}).
These warning indices can then be used to exclude components affected, using argument restr. For example, \code{restr=c(1,3)} excludes components with ambiguous adduct relations and interfering peaks from the 
final component list.
}
\note{
Component IDs are allocated in decreasing peak intensity order of the most intensive peak per component, see section value, \code{comp[[1]]}.

Setting the argument \code{pattern} to \code{FALSE} skips the first step in the algorithm; adducts group are then only searched for a single peak along decreasing peak intensities.
Setting the argument \code{adduct} to \code{FALSE} skips the second step in the algorithm; no adduct groups are then searched for.

\section{Rules setting}{

\code{rules[1]}: Set to \code{TRUE} enables peaks identified as interfering in a component to enter step one of the algorithm (see details).

\code{rules[2]}: Set to \code{TRUE} to remove single-peaked components.

\code{rules[3]}: Set to \code{TRUE} to only list components being part of (a) homologue serie(s).

}

\value{

List of type comp with 7 entries

\item{comp[[1]]}{\code{Components}. Dataframe with listing of individual components, component IDs and concerned peak IDs and warnings per row. 
	The last columns list m/z, intensity and RT of the most intensive peak in that component.}
\item{comp[[2]]}{\code{pattern peak list}. Entry 1 of list of type pattern produced by \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}}, i.e. \code{pattern[[1]]}.}

\item{comp[[4]]}{\code{homologue list}. Entry 1 of list of type homol produced by \code{\link[nontarget]{homol.search}}, i.e. \code{homol[[1]]}.}
\item{comp[[5]]}{\code{Peaks in components}. Vector of \code{TRUE} or\code{FALSE}, indicating if a peak in \code{pattern[[1]]} or \code{adduct[[1]]} is part of a component.}
\item{comp[[6]]}{\code{Summary}.}
\item{comp[[7]]}{\code{Parameters}.}

\section{Imbecile}{
Do not try to combine adduct pattern groups and/or isotope pattern groups and/or homologue series information resulting from different peak lists
to components - that does not make much sense.
