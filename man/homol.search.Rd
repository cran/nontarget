  \item{elements}{ 
  FALSE or chemical elements in the changing units of the homologue series, e.g. c("C","H") for alkane chains. Used to restrict search.
}

  \item{use_C}{
	For \code{elements}: take element ratio to C-atoms into account? Used to restrict search.

  \item{minmz}{
	Defines the lower limit of the m/z window to search homologue series peaks, relative to the m/z of the one peak to search from. Absolute m/z value [u].

	Defines the lower limit of the retention time (RT) window to look for other homologue peaks, relative to the RT of the one peak to search from, i.e., RT-minrt.

	Defines the upper limit of the RT window to look for other homologue peaks, relative to the RT of the one peak to search from, i.e., RT+maxrt.

}

  \item{mztol}{

}

  \item{R2}{
  FALSE or 0<numeric<=1. Coefficient of determination for cubic smoothing spline fits of m/z versus retention time; homologue series with lower R2 are rejected. See \code{\link[stats]{smooth.spline}}.
}

  \item{spar}{
	Smoothing parameter, typically (but not necessarily) in (0,1]. See \code{\link[stats]{smooth.spline}}.
}

	Debug returns, ignore.

}

\details{
A dynamic programming approach is used to extract series of peaks that differ in constant m/z units and smooth changes in their retention time within bounds of mass defect changes. 
First, a nearest neighbour path through a kd-tree representation of the data is used to extract all feasible peak triplets. 
These triplets are then combined to all plausible n-tupels in n-3 steps. At each such step, each newly formed n-tupel is checked for smooth changes of RT with increasing m/z of
the homologues, using cubic splines and a R2-based threshold of the model fit. 
}

\note{
Arguments \code{isotopes} and \code{elements} are needed to limit intermediate numbers of m/z differences to screen over, based on feasible changes in mass defect. 
Similarly, intermediate numbers are also limited by the retention time and m/z windows defined by \code{minmz/maxmz} and \code{minrt/maxrt/rttol}, respectively. 
The latter are always set relative to the individual RT and m/z values of the peaks to be searched from. 
Overall, these parameters must be chosen carefully to avoid a combinatorial explosion of triplet m/z differences, leading to slow computation, memory problems or senseless results.

Values for \code{spar} and \code{R2} have to be adjusted for different chromatographic settings; the smoothing spline fits are used to eliminate homologue series candidates with erratic RT-behaviour.
Spline fits at >=\code{minlength} can be viewed by \code{plotit=2}.

Peak IDs refer to the order in which peaks are provided. Different IDs exist for adduct groups, isotope pattern groups, grouped homologue series (HS) peaks 
and homologue series cluster. Yet other IDs exist for the individual components (see note section of \code{\link[nontarget]{combine}}).

Here, IDs of homologue series group are given both in the function output \code{homol[[1]]}, \code{homol[[3]]} and \code{homol[[6]]}, with one homologue series stating one group of interrelated peaks.

\section{Warning}{
The \code{rttol} argument of \code{\link[nontarget]{homol.search}} must not be mixed with that of \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search}} or \code{\link[nontarget]{pattern.search2}}.
